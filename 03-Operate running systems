        1-Boot, reboot, and shut down a system normally
          Shutdown:
            SysVinit: shutdown -h now
            Systemd: systemctl poweroff
          Reboot:
            SysVinit: shutdown -r now
            Systemd: systemctl reboot
          Single User Mode:
            Helpful for maintenance tasks or recovering from errors.
            SysVinit: telinit 1
            Systemd: systemctl isolate rescue.target

        2-Boot systems into different targets manually
          SysVinit:
            Use the telinit command. E.g., to switch to runlevel 3: telinit 3
          Systemd:
            Use systemctl isolate target. E.g., to switch to the graphical target: systemctl isolate graphical.target
          permannent changes: (remember for the exam, your settings must survive a reboot)
            SysVinit: Modify /etc/inittab, identify the line starting with id:, e.g., id:3:initdefault: where 3 is the runlevel.
            Systemd: Uses ‘targets’ instead of runlevels. For instance: systemctl set-default multi-user.target

        3-Interrupt the boot process in order to gain access to a system
        4-Identify CPU/memory intensive processes and kill processes
          To find a process PID
          # ps
          Signal Name	Single Value	Effect
          SIGHUP	     1	        Hangup, reload a process
          SIGINT	     2	        Interrupt from keyboard
          SIGKILL	     9	        Kill a process
          SIGTERM	    15	        Terminate a process gracefully
          SIGSTOP	17, 19, 23	Stop a process
          To kill a process
          $ kill -15 <pid> (if this does not work: $ kill -9 <pid>)

                
        5-Adjust process scheduling
        6-Manage tuning profiles
        7-Locate and interpret system log files and journals
        8-Preserve system journals
        9-Start, stop, and check the status of network services
        10-Securely transfer files between systems
