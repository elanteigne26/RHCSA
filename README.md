# RHCSA
Notes and processes to pass the Red Hat RHCSA course and certification
This course suggests a user should be able to perform system changes which persist after a reboot.
This guide will provide commands for run-time as well as persistent modifications.
It will also take into account the program-manager (i.e. SysV Init or SystemD).
