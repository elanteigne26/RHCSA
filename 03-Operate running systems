        1-Boot, reboot, and shut down a system normally
        2-Boot systems into different targets manually
          SysVinit:
            Use the telinit command. E.g., to switch to runlevel 3: telinit 3
          Systemd:
            Use systemctl isolate target. E.g., to switch to the graphical target: systemctl isolate graphical.target
          permannent changes:
            SysVinit: Modify /etc/inittab, identify the line starting with id:, e.g., id:3:initdefault: where 3 is the runlevel.
            Systemd: Uses ‘targets’ instead of runlevels. For instance: systemctl set-default multi-user.target

        3-Interrupt the boot process in order to gain access to a system
        4-Identify CPU/memory intensive processes and kill processes
        5-Adjust process scheduling
        6-Manage tuning profiles
        7-Locate and interpret system log files and journals
        8-Preserve system journals
        9-Start, stop, and check the status of network services
        10-Securely transfer files between systems
